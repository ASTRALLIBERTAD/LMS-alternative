class TodoView:
    """Main orchestrator and UI controller for the Learning Management System.

    TodoView serves as the central hub that coordinates all LMS functionality,
    integrating assignment management, student administration, file storage,
    submission tracking, and UI presentation. It manages the view state (teacher
    vs student mode), handles persistent data loading/saving, and provides the
    primary interface for both educators and learners.
    
    This class follows the Facade pattern, presenting a unified interface to
    multiple complex subsystems (assignments, students, storage, submissions).
    It maintains the application state, manages UI components, and delegates
    specialized operations to manager classes while handling cross-cutting
    concerns like overlays, snackbars, and navigation.

    Purpose:
        - Orchestrate interactions between UI and manager subsystems
        - Maintain application state (mode, current user, selections)
        - Provide unified interface for LMS functionality
        - Handle persistent data loading and saving
        - Manage UI layout and component lifecycle
        - Support role-based views (teacher/student modes)
        - Facilitate file attachments and Drive integration
        - Display assignments, students, and submissions

        - **DriveService**: Provides Drive API operations (if available)
        - **NotificationService**: Manages notifications (if available)
        - **ft.Page**: Updates UI and manages overlays/dialogs

    Algorithm:
        **Phase 1: Initialization**:
            1. Store page, callback, and Drive service references
            2. Create data directory (lms_data) if not exists
            3. Import and instantiate manager classes:
                a. DataManager for persistence
                b. StorageManager for Drive operations
                c. AssignmentManager for assignment logic
                d. StudentManager for student management
                e. SubmissionManager for submission handling
            4. Load persistent data:
                a. assignments from data_manager
                b. students from data_manager
                c. submissions from data_manager
                d. saved_links from JSON file
            5. Optionally initialize NotificationService
            6. Set default state: teacher mode, no student selected
            7. Initialize all UI components via _init_ui_components()
        
        **Phase 2: UI Component Initialization (_init_ui_components)**:
            1. Create input fields (title, description, max_score)
            2. Create dropdowns (subject, target, filter, student)
            3. Create pickers (date, time, file)
            4. Create display texts (folder, attachment, deadline)
            5. Create layout containers (assignment_column, form_container)
            6. Create controls (mode_switch, mode_label, buttons)
            7. Store all components as instance attributes
        
        **Phase 3: View Rendering (get_view)**:
            1. Display current assignments via display_assignments()
            2. Build assignment creation form (teacher mode only)
            3. Create header with back button, icon, title
            4. Build mode switcher row with settings button
            5. Add student selector row (student mode only)
            6. Add form container (teacher mode only)
            7. Build assignment list section with filter
            8. Assemble complete layout in Column
            9. Return root Column control

        **Phase 4: Mode Switching (switch_mode)**:
            1. Toggle current_mode based on switch value
            2. Update mode_label text and emoji
            3. Show/hide student selector row
            4. Show/hide form container
            5. Show/hide manage students button
            6. Refresh assignment display
            7. Update page

        **Phase 5: Assignment Display (display_assignments)**:
            1. Clear assignment_column controls
            2. Check current_mode
            3. If teacher: delegate to assignment_manager.display_teacher_view()
            4. If student: delegate to assignment_manager.display_student_view()
            5. Update page to render changes
        
        **Phase 6: Data Interaction**:
            1. User creates/edits/deletes assignment
            2. Manager updates in-memory list
            3. DataManager saves to JSON file
            4. UI refreshes to show changes
        
        **Phase 7: File/Folder Selection**:
            1. User clicks file/folder picker button
            2. Picker dialog opens
            3. User selects file/folder
            4. Callback updates selected_* attributes
            5. Display text updates to show selection
            6. Page updates to render changes

    Example:
        >>> # Initialize TodoView with page and services
        >>> todo_view = TodoView(
        ...     page=page,
        ...     on_back=lambda: page.go('/dashboard'),
        ...     drive_service=drive
        ... )
        >>> 
        >>> # Get view layout and add to page
        >>> layout = todo_view.get_view()
        >>> page.add(layout)
        >>> page.update()
        >>> 
        >>> # User in teacher mode sees:
        >>> # - Assignment creation form
        >>> # - List of all assignments
        >>> # - Manage students button
        >>> 
        >>> # User switches to student mode
        >>> todo_view.switch_mode(switch_event)
        >>> # User now sees:
        >>> # - Student selector dropdown
        >>> # - Assignments assigned to selected student
        >>> # - Submit buttons on assignments
        >>> 
        >>> # Display success message
        >>> todo_view.show_snackbar("Assignment created!", ft.Colors.GREEN)

        - UI components stored as attributes for dynamic updates
        - Mode switch controls visibility of role-specific components
        - Drive service optional - features gracefully degrade if None
        - Notification service optional - loaded conditionally
        - Overlay system supports modal dialogs with custom content
        - Snackbar provides transient notifications
        - Filter dropdown dynamically updates assignment display
        - Student dropdown includes registration option
        - File attachments support local files and Drive folders
        - Deadline selection uses two-step process (date then time)

    Design Patterns:
        - **Facade Pattern**: Provides unified interface to complex subsystems
        - **Mediator Pattern**: Coordinates interactions between managers
        - **Observer Pattern**: UI updates triggered by state changes

    def __init__(self, page: ft.Page, on_back=None, drive_service=None):
        """Initialize TodoView with page, navigation callback, and Drive service.

        Constructs the LMS view by setting up data persistence, instantiating
        manager subsystems, loading existing data, and initializing all UI
        components. Prepares the complete application state for rendering.

        Args:
            page (ft.Page): Flet page instance for UI rendering, updates, and
                overlay management. Must be initialized and active.
            on_back (Callable, optional): Callback function invoked when user
                clicks back button. Typically navigates to dashboard. Signature:
                () -> None. Defaults to None (back button hidden).
            drive_service (DriveService, optional): Google Drive service wrapper
                providing file/folder operations. If None, Drive features are
                disabled or degraded. Defaults to None.

        Algorithm:

            **Phase 1: Store Core References**   
                1. Assign page to self.page      
                2. Assign on_back to self.on_back
                3. Assign drive_service to self.drive_service

                2. Store in self.data_dir
                3. Call mkdir(exist_ok=True) to create if needed
                4. Directory contains JSON files for persistence


            **Phase 3: Import Manager Classes**
                1. Import DataManager from ui.todo_modules.data_manager
                2. Import StorageManager from ui.todo_modules.storage_manager
                3. Import AssignmentManager from ui.todo_modules.assignment_manager
                4. Import StudentManager from ui.todo_modules.student_manager
                5. Import SubmissionManager from ui.todo_modules.submission_manager


            **Phase 4: Instantiate Managers**
                1. Create DataManager(data_dir, drive_service)
                2. Create StorageManager(self, drive_service)
                3. Create AssignmentManager(self)
                4. Create StudentManager(self)
                5. Create SubmissionManager(self)
                6. Each manager stores reference to TodoView (self)


            **Phase 5: Load Persistent Data**
                1. Call data_manager.load_assignments() -> list
                2. Store in self.assignments
                3. Call data_manager.load_students() -> list
                4. Store in self.students

                3. Instantiate NotificationService(data_dir)
                    a. Store in self.notification_service
                4. If ImportError:
                5. Set self.notification_service = None
                    a. Feature gracefully disabled


            **Phase 7: Set Initial State**
                1. Set self.current_mode = "teacher"
                2. Set self.current_student_email = None
                3. Default view is teacher mode with no student selected


            **Phase 8: Initialize UI Components**
                1. Call self._init_ui_components()
                2. Creates all input fields, dropdowns, pickers, etc.
                3. Stores components as instance attributes
                4. Components ready for get_view() to assemble

        Interactions:
            - **Path.mkdir()**: Creates data directory
            - **DataManager**: Loads assignments, students, submissions

        Creates and configures every UI component used by TodoView including
        input fields, dropdowns, pickers, display texts, buttons, and layout
        containers. Stores all components as instance attributes for later
        access and modification. Does not attach components to page; assembly
        happens in get_view().

        Returns:
            None: Creates and stores UI components as instance attributes.

        Algorithm:

            **Phase 1: Create Input Fields**
                1. Create assignment_title TextField (hint: "Assignment Title")
                2. Create assignment_description TextField:
                    - Multiline: True
                    - Min lines: 3, max lines: 5
                    - Hint: "Description/Instructions"
                3. Create max_score_field TextField:
                    - Width: 150px
                    - Keyboard type: NUMBER
                    - Input filter: NumbersOnlyInputFilter


            **Phase 2: Create Dropdown Selectors**
                1. Create subject_dropdown with options:

                    - "regular" -> "Regular Only"
                    - Default value: "all", width: 200px
                3. Create filter_dropdown with options:
                    - All, Active, Completed, Overdue
                    - Default: "All", width: 150px
                    - on_change: lambda e: display_assignments()
                4. Create student_dropdown:
                    - Width: 250px
                    - on_change: on_student_selected
                    - Populated by student_manager


            **Phase 3: Initialize Drive Folder Selection**
                1. Set selected_drive_folder_id = None
                2. Create drive_folder_label Text:
                    - Value: "No folder selected"
                    - Size: 12px, italic: True


            **Phase 4: Initialize File Attachment**
                1. Create attachment_text Text:
                    - Value: "No file attached"
                    - Size: 12px, italic: True
                2. Create selected_attachment dict:
                    - Keys: "path", "name"
                    - Initial values: None


            **Phase 5: Initialize Deadline Selection**
                1. Set selected_date_value = None
                2. Set selected_time_value = None
                3. Create selected_deadline_display Text:

                    - Size: 12px, italic: True
                4. Create date_picker DatePicker:
                    - on_change: on_date_selected
                5. Create time_picker TimePicker:
                    - on_change: on_time_selected


            **Phase 6: Create Layout Containers**
                1. Create assignment_column Column:
                    - Scroll: "auto", expand: True
                    - Spacing: 10px
                    - Will hold assignment cards


            **Phase 7: Create Mode Controls**
                1. Create mode_switch Switch:
                    - Value: False (teacher mode)
                    - on_change: switch_mode
                2. Create mode_label Text:
                    - Value: "👨‍🏫 Teacher View"
                    - Size: 16px, weight: BOLD


            **Phase 8: Create Action Buttons**
                1. Create settings_btn ElevatedButton:
                    - Text: "Storage"
                    - Icon: SETTINGS
                    - on_click: storage_manager.show_storage_settings


            **Phase 9: Create Student Selector Row**
                1. Create student_selector_row Row:
                    - Contains: Text("Viewing as:"), student_dropdown
                    - Visible: False (only in student mode)
                2. Call student_manager.update_student_dropdown():
                    - Populates dropdown with student emails


            **Phase 10: Initialize Containers (created later in get_view)**
                1. Set form_container = None (created in get_view)
                2. Set manage_students_btn = None (created in get_view)

        Interactions:
            - **ft.TextField, ft.Dropdown, ft.DatePicker, etc.**: UI component creation
            - **student_manager.update_student_dropdown()**: Populates student dropdown
            - **Event handlers**: Registered for dropdowns, switch, pickers

        Example:
            >>> # After initialization
            >>> todo = TodoView(page, callback, drive)
            >>> # All components created and stored
            >>> print(todo.assignment_title.hint_text)
            Assignment Title
            >>> print(len(todo.subject_dropdown.options))
            8
            >>> print(todo.mode_switch.value)
            False
            >>> print(todo.assignment_column.scroll)
            auto

        Returns:
            list: List of saved link dictionaries. Each link contains:
                - id (str): Drive folder/file ID
                - name (str): Display name for link
                - url (str): Full Drive URL
                Returns empty list if file doesn't exist or can't be parsed.

        Algorithm:

            **Phase 1: Check File Existence**
                1. Check if SAVED_LINKS_FILE ("saved_links.json") exists

        Interactions:
            - **saved_links**: Searches in-memory link cache
            - **DriveService.get_file_info()**: Queries Drive API for metadata
