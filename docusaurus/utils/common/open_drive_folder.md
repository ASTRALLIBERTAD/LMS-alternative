Open a Google Drive folder in the default web browser.

Constructs a Drive folder URL from the folder ID and opens it in
the system's default browser. Convenience wrapper around open_url
for Drive folder links.

## Purpose

- Open Drive folders in browser
        - Construct proper Drive folder URL from ID
        - Provide convenient API for Drive folder opening

## Parameters

- **`folder_id`** (str): Google Drive folder ID (typically 33-character alphanumeric string). Example: "1def...uvw"

## Returns

**Type**: `None`


## Algorithm

  - 1. **Construct URL**:
    - a. Build URL string: f"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/&#123;folder_id&#125;"
    - b. URL format: Drive folder listing endpoint

  - 2. **Open Browser**:
    - a. Call open_url() with constructed URL
    - b. Browser opens to Drive folder view

## Interactions

- **open_url()**: Opens browser with constructed URL

## Example

```python
# Open Drive folder
folder_id = "1def...uvw"
open_drive_folder(folder_id)
# Browser opens: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1def...uvw
# User sees folder contents in Drive
```

## See Also

- `open_url()`: Opens any URL in browser
- `open_drive_file()`: Opens Drive file
- `extract_drive_id()`: Extracts ID from Drive URL

## Notes

- User must have access permissions to view folder
- Shows folder contents in standard Drive interface
- Non-blocking operation
