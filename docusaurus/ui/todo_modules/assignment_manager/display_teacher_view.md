Render the assignment list for the teacher mode.

## Purpose

Displays assignments with administrative controls (Edit, Delete, View Submissions).

## Algorithm

- 1. Get current filter (All, Active, Completed, Overdue).
  - 2. Filter `todo.assignments` based on deadline status.
  - 3. If empty -> Show placeholder.
  - 4. Else -> Loop through assignments, create cards, append to UI column.

## Interactions

- Reads `todo.assignments`.
- Reads `todo.filter_dropdown`.
- Calls `create_teacher_assignment_card`.
